## Kriegsman

This is my game for CI328-CI587 - Internet game design and development, it’s loosely based on the 
siege of Vraks Warhammer 40k books. In this game the player is a death korps of krieg guardsman, 
that has to face off against swarms of cultists on the Imperial Armoury World of Vraks.

### Running this project locally

As this project uses webpack node package manager will need to be installed, to do this install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then navigate to the project and run the following commands in 
the terminal:

-   Install all dependencies using command “npm install”.

-   Then run “npm start” to start the dev server. The project will launch in the browser (Chrome) 
    automatically as the project is set up to run web pack on a local dev server using the node package 
    webpack-dev-server.

-   To stop the server from running use “crt+c” in the terminal.

If for any reason the build fails, the project can camp accessed via this [Link](https://thirsty-hermann-61142f.netlify.app/). 
Please note that the game may take a minute or two too load but it will load. This is due to the large amounts of assets this 
project contains.
