## Kriegsman

This is my game for CI328-CI587 - Internet game design and development, itâ€™s loosely based on the siege of Vraks Warhammer 40k books. In this game you as the player are a death korps of krieg guardsman, that has to face off against  swarms  of cultists on the Imperial Armoury World of Vraks.
